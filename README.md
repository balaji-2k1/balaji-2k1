# Hi, I'm Balaji 👋

Nothing fancy.

I build things.  
Earlier it was mostly models.  
Now it’s more about using AI properly while building real systems.

---

## What I actually do

I use AI as a coding partner.

- Refactor messy codebases
- Generate first drafts faster
- Validate edge cases
- Think through architecture

---

## Current focus

- LLM pipelines
- Retrieval and embeddings
- LLM Fine Tuning
- Open source LLM models
- Evaluation of AI outputs
- Clean system design with AI assistance
- Automating repetitive dev workflows

I care more about:
- clarity
- maintainability
- thinking systems through
than just writing a lot of code.

---

## Tech I use

Python · Node.js ·Docker ·Kubernetes · Neo4j · Qdrant · Langfuse · LiteLLM · Ollama · LangChain-style patterns · embeddings · OpenAI-compatible APIs · Linux 
---

## How I think about AI

AI is not magic.It’s leverage.

If used correctly:
- it reduces iteration time
- improves clarity
- helps explore design space
- catches blind spots

But it still needs judgment.

That part I’m continuously improving.
